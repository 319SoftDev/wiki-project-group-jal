# Physical Features 

**_Cats have the same five basic senses as humans, but they differ in function and sensitivity. Some cat senses are much stronger than human senses.
Because differences between cat breeds can be subtle, especially compared with the differences between dog breeds, cats are routinely identified according to a basic physical characteristic, such as color, coat pattern, body size, or hair length. “Black,” “orange tabby,” “longhaired,” “shorthaired”—all are common categories by which cats are identified, advertised, and sought._**

_-**Teeth:** A cat’s teeth are adapted to three functions: stabbing, anchoring, and cutting. Cats have no flat-crowned crushing teeth and therefore cannot chew their food; instead, they cut it up. Except for the canines and molars, the cat’s teeth are more or less nonfunctional; most of the cheek teeth do not even meet when the mouth is closed.  
-**Claws:** The cat’s claws retract when not in use. The action that unsheathes the claws also spreads the toes widely, making the foot more than twice as broad as it normally is and converting it into a formidable weapon. This claw-sheathing mechanism is present in all species of the cat family except the cheetah. Although there are no nerve endings in the nail itself, blood capillaries are present in the inner, “quick” area. This is why, when trimming the nails of domestic cats, pet owners should cut the sharp white tip of the nail but not the pink quick, since cutting the latter can be painful for a cat.  
-**Ears:** Not only is the cat’s hearing acute, but its outer ears are equipped with more than a dozen muscles that allow the ears to swivel 180 degrees. This allows the ears to pivot toward the source of sounds, and the ear shape helps funnel sounds into the ears. This design also makes it easier to precisely locate the source of sounds._  

_**-Tail:** The tail is part of the spine and generally contains an additional 20-some caudal vertebrae. The exception is breeds such as the Manx and the Japanese Bobtail, which have mutations that give them short tails or no tails at all. The cat’s tail is mobile and used for both balance and communication. It acts as a counterweight, but it is the cat’s sense of equilibrium and its flexible spine that allow it to self-right when falling._
