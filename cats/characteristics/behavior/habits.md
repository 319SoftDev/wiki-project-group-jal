# Habits They Have 

_Common cat habits include sleeping for long hours, grooming themselves, kneading, rubbing their faces to mark territory, scratching to condition claws and leave scent marks, and exhibiting crepuscular (dawn and dusk) activity patterns. Their behaviors are influenced by their personality, environment, and need for routine, safety, and stimulation. Understanding these habits can help you provide a suitable environment, recognize signs of stress or illness, and strengthen your bond with your cat._ 

## Daily Habits 

* Sleeping: Cats sleep for many hours a day (16-18 hours or more) to conserve energy, and they often choose high or secluded spots for security and temperature regulation. 
* Grooming: Cats are fastidious groomers, using it to keep clean, soothe themselves, and spread their scent. 
* Kneading: This rhythmic pushing of their paws against a soft surface is a comforting behavior from kittenhood, often indicating contentment, relaxation, or affection. 
* Purring: While often a sign of happiness, purring can also be a self-soothing mechanism used when a cat is in pain or feeling stressed. 
* Crepuscular Activity: Many cats are most active during dawn and dusk, an instinct from when they hunted for prey. 

### Territorial Habits

* Rubbing and Bunting: Cats rub their heads, faces, and bodies against objects and people to deposit their scent from glands on their head, marking their territory and creating a sense of familiarity. 
* Scratching: Scratching serves to condition claws and mark territory through both visible marks and scent glands on their paws. 

### Social and Environmental Habits

* Routine: Cats thrive on consistency and establish routines for feeding, playing, and quiet time. Disruptions can cause stress. 
* Personal Space: Cats value their personal space and need designated areas, like beds or perches, where they can retreat to feel secure. 
* Small Spaces: Cats often seek out small, tight spaces for security, allowing them to watch their surroundings while feeling safe. 
* Vocalizations: Meowing can be a greeting, a way to seek attention, or a form of communication between a mother and her kittens. Hissing, spitting, or yowling indicate aggression, distress, or fear.

### Why Understanding Habits Matters

* Health and Stress: Unusual changes in a cat's sleep patterns, location, or grooming can signal pain, illness, anxiety, or stress, according to Veterinary Specialists of the Rockies. 
* Environmental Enrichment: Providing things like scratching posts, high perches, and interactive toys can help meet their natural needs for exercise and stimulation. 
* Stronger Bond: Understanding your cat's unique habits helps you provide an environment where they feel safe and loved, strengthening your bond.
