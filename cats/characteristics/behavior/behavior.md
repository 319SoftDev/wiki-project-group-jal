# Cats Behavior 

_Cat behavior encompasses the actions and reactions displayed by a cat in response to various stimuli and events. Cat behavior includes body language, elimination habits, aggression, play, communication, hunting, grooming, urine marking, and face rubbing. It varies among individuals, colonies, and breeds._

_Communication and sociability can vary greatly among individual cats. In a family with many cats, the interactions can change depending on which individuals are present and how restricted the territory and resources are. One or more individuals may become aggressive: fighting may occur with the attack, resulting in scratches and deep bite wounds._

When getting a new cat, you should be aware of the 3-3-3 rule.

**The 3-3-3 rule :** The 3-3-3 Rule for cats is a general guideline for the decompression and adjustment period after a cat enters a new home. In the first 3 days, the cat will decompress and may hide, feel overwhelmed, or be stressed. Over the next 3 weeks, the cat will begin to adjust, learn the routine, and increase their exploration and trust. By 3 months, the cat will likely feel fully at home, show their true personality, and have established strong bonds with their new family. This rule emphasizes patience and understanding to help a new cat settle into a forever home.  

#### First 3 Days: Decompression Phase 
* _Signs:_  The cat may seem nervous, hide, be reluctant to eat, or avoid the litter box.   
* _Action:_  Provide the cat with a quiet space, a safe hiding spot, food, water, and a litter box. Give them plenty of space and allow them to explore at their own pace.  

#### Next 3 Weeks: Adjustment Phase
* _Signs:_  The cat will show increased curiosity, start to respond to routine cues, and may begin venturing out of their designated area.   
* _Action:_  Establish and maintain a consistent routine for meals and play to build trust and a sense of security. Continue to provide a safe space for them to retreat to if needed.  

#### By 3 Months: Settling-In Phase 
* _Signs:_  The cat should feel comfortable, show their full personality, become more affectionate, and integrate into the family.   
* _Action:_  Continue with established routines and spend quality time bonding with the cat through play and positive interaction.  

#### Key Takeaway:
* Patience is crucial: Every cat adjusts differently, so don't rush the process.   
* Consistency builds security: A predictable routine helps your cat feel safe.   
* Give them time: Don't expect your new cat to be fully settled and affectionate immediately; it takes time for them to feel truly "home".
