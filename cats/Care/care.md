# Taking Care Of Cats 

Caring for a cat involves providing proper nutrition with a meat-based diet, ensuring constant access to fresh water, maintaining a clean litter box, offering a safe and stimulating environment with beds and climbing options, and ensuring regular veterinary care including vaccinations and parasite control. You should also provide daily enrichment through play and grooming, such as brushing and nail trimming, to keep your cat healthy and happy.
